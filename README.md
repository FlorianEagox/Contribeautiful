A vue & express webapp to generate custom GitHub contribution history!

![Project Status: Active, MVP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Active%2C%20MVP-green)
# TODO

## Definitely
- REDO THAT GOD AWFUL DESIGN
- User prompts of completed, error etc
- Storing the last commit in the DB so we don't clone a repo with things the app didn't create
- Revoke authorization and delete data
- Tooltip of the date you're drawing on
- Calendar stops at Dec 31st
- Switch to ES6 modules for the backend instead of CommonJS
## Possible
- Edit none-destructively: check for commits already made that day and not commit if we don't need to
- Delete the repo from the website
- Import an image as a 52x7 github contribution history image
- graph of current year starts with the current date of last year and goes to current date
- Delete individual years of history
- Better click detection / drawing tools
